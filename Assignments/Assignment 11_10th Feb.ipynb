When you open a file in read mode, you cannot write to it or make any \\nchanges to it. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError will be raised.\\n\\n'w' (write mode) - This mode is used when you want to write to a file. If the \\nfile already exists, its contents will be overwritten. If the file does not \\nexist, a new file will be created.\\n\\n'a' (append mode) - This mode is used when you want to add new content to the \\nend of an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be \\ncreated. In append mode, you can only write to the end of the file, and not \\nanywhere else.\\n\\n'x' (exclusive creation mode) - This mode is used when you want to create a \\nnew file and write to it, but only if the file does not already exist. If the \\nfile already exists, a FileExistsError will be raised.\\n\\n'b' (binary mode) - This mode is used when you want to read or write binary \\ndata to a file. When opening a file in binary mode, you should use 'rb' to \\nread binary data and 'wb' to write binary data.\\n\\n't' (text mode) - This mode is used when you want to read or write text data \\nto a file. When opening a file in text mode, you should use 'rt' to read text \\ndata and 'wt' to write text data.\\n\\nYou can combine these modes when opening a file, for example: 'rb' to open a \\nbinary file in read mode, 'wt' to open a text file in write mode, etc. The \\ndefault mode is 'rt' (read text mode) if no mode is specified.\\n\\n\""
