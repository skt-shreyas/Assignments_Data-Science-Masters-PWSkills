This includes the ability to be raised and caught with a \\ntry/except block, and the ability to store and retrieve error messages \\nassociated with the exception.\\n\\nInheriting from the Exception class also makes it easier to catch specific \\ntypes of exceptions in your code. For example, you could catch all exceptions \\nthat are subclasses of Exception using a single except block, or you could \\ncatch only specific types of exceptions by catching their corresponding custom\\nexceptions.\\n\\n'"

    "The threading module in Python is used to create and manage threads in a \n",

    "your Python program:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: Threading allows multiple parts of a program to run concurrently,\n",
    "which can improve the performance and efficiency of the program. By running \n",
    "multiple threads at the same time, the program can utilize the available \n",
    "hardware resources more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous I/O: Threading can be used to perform asynchronous I/O operations,\n",
    "where the program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for I/O \n",
    "operations to complete. This can be useful in applications that involve \n",
    "network communication, file I/O, or other types of I/O that are blocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Threading can be used to perform tasks in parallel, where multiple\n",
    "threads can work on the same task simultaneously. This can be useful in \n",
    "applications that involve heavy computation, as it can reduce the time required \n",
    "to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronization: Threading provides mechanisms for synchronizing access to \n",
    "shared resources, such as data structures or files, to avoid conflicts and \n",
    "ensure thread safety.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>> activeCount(): The activeCount() function is used to get the number of \n",
    "thread objects that are currently active in the program. This can be useful \n",
    "for monitoring the status of threads and ensuring that all threads have \n",
    "completed before exiting the program.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>> currentThread(): The currentThread() function is used to get a reference \n",
    "to the current thread object that is executing the function. This can be \n",
    "useful for identifying the current thread, and for passing the thread object \n",
    "to other functions for manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>> enumerate(): The enumerate() function is used to get a list of all thread\n",
    "objects that are currently active in the program. This can be useful for \n",

This \\ncan make it easier to diagnose and fix the problem.\\n\\n>>> Use exceptions for exceptional situations: Exceptions should be used to \\nhandle unexpected or exceptional situations that cannot be handled through \\nnormal control flow. Don't use exceptions for normal control flow, such as to \\ncheck if a file exists before opening it.\\n\\n>>> Avoid using exceptions for control flow: Exceptions should not be used \\nas a mechanism for control flow. Instead, use a simple if statement or another\\ncontrol flow construct to check for expected conditions.\\n\\n>>> Don't ignore exceptions: When you catch an exception, it is important to \\nhandle it properly, rather than just ignoring it. Ignoring exceptions can lead\\nto unexpected behavior and can make it more difficult to diagnose and fix \\nproblems.\\n\\n>>> Use finally to clean up resources: The finally clause can be used to ensure\\nthat resources are properly cleaned up, even if an exception occurs. This can \\ninclude closing files, releasing resources, and restoring the state of the \\nprogram.\\n\\n>>> Consider using context managers: Context managers are a convenient way to \\nmanage resources in a Python program.
